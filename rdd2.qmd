## Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity

What if we have a cutoff $X=c$ that determines treatment $D$ for most units, but not all.

-   There are some people that should be treated based on the cutoff, but are "not complying" with the cutoff.

We can instead use a **Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity**.

-   Basic idea: Use the cutoff $X=c$ as a **instrumental variable** for the actual treatment $D$.

-   As long as the cutoff makes it more likely for someone to get treatment $D$, then the cutoff should be correlated with $D$ (relevance).

## Example and Setup

Example: scoring over 90% makes you **eligible** for a advanced-level class. However, you do not have to take the class.

-   Issue: some people eligible for the advanced-class will decide not to take it.

Our research design will be as follows:

-   Cutoff $X=c$ perfectly determines the instrument $Z$ - whether you are "encouraged" to take the treatment $D$ (the advanced class).

-   Treatment $D$ - whether someone actually takes the advanced class. Not all individuals "encouraged" in variable $Z$ (above the cutoff) will take it, but being above the cutoff is correlated with taking the class.

## Estimation

**Stage 1**: Estimate the causal effect of $Z$ on $Y$, which we call $\tau_{ITT}$

-   This is done by running a Sharp regression discontinuity of cutoff $X=c$ with outcome variable $Y$ (like last lecture).

**Stage 2:** Calculate Pr(compliers), the causal effect of $Z$ on $D$:

-   This is done by running a Sharp regression discontinuity of cutoff $X=c$ with **outcome variable** $D$**.**

**Stage 3**: Calculate $\tau_\text{LATE}$ using formula from lecture 7:

$$
\tau_\text{LATE} = \frac{\tau_\text{ITT}}{Pr(\text{compliers})}
$$

Note: **rdrobust** package in **R** does all three steps together, which makes things very simple.

## Additional Notes on Fuzzy RDD

The $\tau_\text{LATE}$ of fuzzy RDD is a very narrow interpretation.

-   It is the causal effect of only **compliers** who are near the cutoff $X=c$.

-   Basically a combination of $\tau_\text{LATE}$ interpretation from IV and RDD.

Assumptions also combine RDD with IV.

-   We need continuity of potential outcomes of $Y$. We also need continuity in likelihood of being treated $D$ (for the second stage RDD).

-   We need IV assumptions of exclusions, relevance, and relevance.

## Regression Kink

Regression Discontinuity focuses on if there is a "jump"/"discontinuity" in $Y$ at some cutoff.

What if there isn't a "jump", but a change in the relationship (slope) between the running variable and outcome?

## Regression Kink Setup

Our setup for regression kink is very similar to standard RDD:

-   We have a treatment $D$ and a outcome $Y$.

-   Treatment $D$ is assigned based on some **running** variable $X$. Some cutoff $X=c$ determines if a unit is treated or not treated.

**Difference**: Instead of looking for a jump in $Y$, we will look for a slope shift in the relationship between $X$ and $Y$.

Thus, our goal is not to find the LATE, but instead, to find the **local average response**.

-   Local average response is how much the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ changes at the cutoff $X=c$.

## Derivatives and Discontinuity

Our goal in regression kink is to find a change in the slope. Let us first define the relationship between $Y$ and $X$ as a function:

$$
f(X) = Y
$$

-   We will not specify any function form for now - this is just for illustration purposes.

What is the slope between $X$ and $Y$? Well, it is the first derivative of the function $f(X) = Y$.

This implies that our goal in regression kink is to **find a discontinuity in the first derivative** $f'(X)$ at the cutoff point $X=c$.

## Assumption: Continuity of Derivative

In regression discontinuity, one of the assumptions was that if there was no treatment at $X=c$, then there would be no "jump"/discontinuity in $Y$ (so $Y_i(0)$ is continuous).

Our goal in regression kink is to find a discontinuity in the first derivative $f'(X)$ at the cutoff point $X=c$.

-   Thus, our identification assumption in regression kink is that if there was no treatment, $f'(X)$ is continuous at the cutoff.

-   Or in terms of potential outcomes, if $f(X) = Y_i(0)$, then $f'(X)$ must be continuous at the cutoff $c=0$.

If this is not true (i.e. there is a "jump"/"discontinuity" in the slope/derivative at $X=c$ even without treatment), then we do not know if the "jump"/"discontinuity" we observe is a result of the treatment $D$.

## Estimation

Estimation is done in a similar way as sharp regression discontinuity:

-   Fit a best-fit line on both sides of the cutoff.

-   Then, find the derivative of the best-fit line.

-   Finally, check for any discontinuity in the derivatives.

The recommended procedure is to use the local linear regression method, just like in regression discontinuity.

-   The **rdrobust** package allows for a simple option to turn a regression discontinuity into a regression kink.

We can also estimate this with a parametric model (linear, quadratic), but again, this is not recommended unless your sample size is very small.
