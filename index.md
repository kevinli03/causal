<!-- # Introduction to Causal Inference  -->

### About

This is a collection of resources on Causal Inference basics and methods - with a specific focus on methods used in Political Science and Political Economy (PSPE). This is more of a broad overview of causal inference, rather than diving deep into any one method.

These resources are a collection of the content I learned during my postgraduate degree at the London School of Economics.

For a more detailed look at difference-in-differences, see my [repository on DiD](https://kevinli03.github.io/did/). For more about me, see my [github page](https://kevinli03.github.io).

### Lectures and Resources

Each lecture contains slides covering the basics of each topic. Links to additional helpful resources are included. See appendix for some background materials.

#### 1. Causal Frameworks I: Exogeneity

*In this lecture, I introduce the issue of confounders in causal identification, and how it relates to randomness/exogeneity.*

-   [Lecture Slides](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/frameworks1.pdf)

#### 2. Causal Frameworks II: Potential Outcomes

*In this lecture, I discuss the potential outcomes framework for causal inference, and introduce the main estimands: ATE, ATT, and LATE.*

-   [Lecture Slides](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/frameworks2.pdf)

#### 3. Difference-in-Differences I: Classical DiD

*In this lecture, I introduce the classical 2-period Difference-in-Differences design used for causal identification, and the parallel trends assumption*.

-   [Lecture Slides](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/did1.pdf)

#### 4. Difference-in-Differences II: Generalised DiD

*In this lecture, I expand DiD to multiple pre-and-post periods, introduce the two-way fixed effects estimator, and discuss conditioning for parallel trends.*

-   [Lecture Slides](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/did2.pdf)

#### 5. Difference-in-Differences III: Staggered DiD

*In this lecture, I expend DiD to staggered treatment settings, discuss the issues with TWFE in staggered settings, and discuss modern advances in DiD*.

-   [Lecture Slides](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/did3.pdf)

#### 6. Difference-in-Differences IV: Extensions

*In this lecture, I talk about extending Difference-in-differences to scenarios where parallel trends does not hold, including IFEct, MC, and synthetic controls.*

-   [Lecture Slides](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/did4.pdf)

#### 7. Instrumental Variables and 2SLS

*In this lecture, I introduce the theory behind instrumental variables and why they can find causal effects, as well as the 2-stage least squares estimator.*

-   [Lecture Slides](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/iv1.pdf)

#### 8. Regression Discontinuity I: Sharp RDD

*In this lecture, I introduce the regression discontinuity design and its sharp variant, as well as the key identification assumptions and design of RDD*.

-   [Lecture Slides](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/rdd1.pdf)

#### 9. Regression Discontinuity II: Extensions

*In this lecture, I discuss extensions of the RDD design, including fuzzy RDD for non-compliance with cutoffs, and regression kink design.*

-   [Lecture Slides](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/rdd2.pdf)

#### 10. Randomised Experiments I: Basics

*In this lecture, I discuss the design of randomised experiments, the assumptions needed and how to check them with balance tests, and other fundamental concepts of randomisation.*

-   Lecture Slides

#### 11. Randomised Experiments II: Extensions

*In this lecture, I discuss extensions to randomised experiments, including non-compliance settings and survey experiments.*

-   Lecture Slides

#### 12. Selection on Observables

*In this lecture, I introduce the least convincing, but often only plausible research design for causal inference - selection on observables. I discuss regression and matching strategies.*
