<!-- # Introduction to Causal Inference  -->

### About

This is a collection of resources on Causal Inference basics and methods - with a specific focus on methods used in Political Science and Political Economy (PSPE). I assume a basic understanding of regression (how to interpret coefficients, how regression equations look like), as well as a basic understanding of statistical inference. Additional Resources in appendix.

These resources are a collection of the content I learned during my postgraduate degree at the London School of Economics.

For a more detailed look at difference-in-differences, see my [repository on DiD](https://kevinli03.github.io/did/). For more about me, see my [github page](https://kevinli03.github.io).

### Lectures and Resources

Each lecture contains slides covering the basics of each topic. Links to additional helpful resources are included.

#### 1. Causal Frameworks I: Exogeneity

*In this lecture, I introduce the issue of confounders in causal identification, and how it relates to randomness/exogeneity.*

[Lecture Slides](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/frameworks1.pdf)

#### 2. Causal Frameworks II: Potential Outcomes

*In this lecture, I discuss the potential outcomes framework for causal inference, and introduce the main estimands: ATE, ATT, and LATE.*

[Lecture Slides](https://kevinli03.github.io/causal/frameworks2.pdf)

#### 3. Difference-in-Differences I: Classical DiD

*In this lecture, I introduce the classical 2-period Difference-in-Differences design used for causal identification, and the parallel trends assumption*.

#### 4. Difference-in-Differences II: Generalised DiD

*In this lecture, I expand DiD to multiple pre-and-post periods, introduce the two-way fixed effects estimator, and discuss conditioning for parallel trends.*

Lecture Slides

#### 5. Difference-in-Differences III: Staggered DiD

*In this lecture, I expend DiD to staggered treatment settings, discuss the issues with TWFE in staggered settings, and discuss modern advances in DiD*.

Lecture Slides

#### 6. Regression Discontinuity Design

*In this lecture, I introduce the regression discontinuity design and its sharp variant, as well as the key identification assumptions and design of RDD*.

Lecture Slides

#### 7. Instrumental Variables Design

*In this lecture, I introduce the intuition behind instrumental variables, and discuss the two-stage least squares estimator*.

Lecture Slides

#### 8. Selection on Observables

*In this lecture, I discuss matching designs, such as distance matching, propensity score matching, and genetic matching.*
