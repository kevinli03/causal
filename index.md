<!-- # Introduction to Causal Inference  -->

### About

This is a collection of resources on Causal Inference basics and methods - with a specific focus on methods used in Political Science and Political Economy (PSPE). I assume a basic understanding of regression (how to interpret coefficients, how regression equations look like), as well as a basic understanding of statistical inference. Additional Resources in appendix.

These resources are a collection of the content I learned during my postgraduate degree at the London School of Economics.

For a more detailed look at difference-in-differences, see my [repository on DiD](https://kevinli03.github.io/did/). For more about me, see my [github page](https://kevinli03.github.io).
